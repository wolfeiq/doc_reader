# Tools

Tools let agents take actions: things like fetching data, running code, calling external APIs, and even using a computer. The SDK supports five categories:

-   Hosted OpenAI tools: run alongside the model on OpenAI servers.
-   Local runtime tools: run in your environment (computer use, shell, apply patch).
-   Function calling: wrap any Python function as a tool.
-   Agents as tools: expose an agent as a callable tool without a full handoff.
-   Experimental: Codex tool: run workspace-scoped Codex tasks from a tool call.

## Hosted tools

OpenAI offers a few built-in tools when using the [`OpenAIResponsesModel`][agents.models.openai_responses.OpenAIResponsesModel]:

-   The [`WebSearchTool`][agents.tool.WebSearchTool] lets an agent search the web.
-   The [`FileSearchTool`][agents.tool.FileSearchTool] allows retrieving information from your OpenAI Vector Stores.
-   The [`CodeInterpreterTool`][agents.tool.CodeInterpreterTool] lets the LLM execute code in a sandboxed environment.
-   The [`HostedMCPTool`][agents.tool.HostedMCPTool] exposes a remote MCP server's tools to the model.
-   The [`ImageGenerationTool`][agents.tool.ImageGenerationTool] generates images from a prompt.

```python
from agents import Agent, FileSearchTool, Runner, WebSearchTool

agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    tools=[
        WebSearchTool(),
        FileSearchTool(
            max_num_results=3,
            vector_store_ids=["VECTOR_STORE_ID"],
        ),
    ],
)

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "Which coffee shop should I go to, taking into account my preferences and the weather today in SF?")
    print(result.final_output)
```

## Local runtime tools

Local runtime tools execute in your environment and require you to supply implementations:

-   [`ComputerTool`][agents.tool.ComputerTool]: implement the [`Computer`][agents.computer.Computer] or [`AsyncComputer`][agents.computer.AsyncComputer] interface to enable GUI/browser automation.
-   [`ShellTool`][agents.tool.ShellTool] or [`LocalShellTool`][agents.tool.LocalShellTool]: provide a shell executor to run commands.
-   [`ApplyPatchTool`][agents.tool.ApplyPatchTool]: implement [`ApplyPatchEditor`][agents.editor.ApplyPatchEditor] to apply diffs locally.

```python
from agents import Agent, ApplyPatchTool, ShellTool
from agents.computer import AsyncComputer
from agents.editor import ApplyPatchResult, ApplyPatchOperation, ApplyPatchEditor


class NoopComputer(AsyncComputer):
    environment = "browser"
    dimensions = (1024, 768)
    async def screenshot(self): return ""
    async def click(self, x, y, button): ...
    async def double_click(self, x, y): ...
    async def scroll(self, x, y, scroll_x, scroll_y): ...
    async def type(self, text): ...
    async def wait(self): ...
    async def move(self, x, y): ...
    async def keypress(self, keys): ...
    async def drag(self, path): ...


class NoopEditor(ApplyPatchEditor):
    async def create_file(self, op: ApplyPatchOperation): return ApplyPatchResult(status="completed")
    async def update_file(self, op: ApplyPatchOperation): return ApplyPatchResult(status="completed")
    async def delete_file(self, op: ApplyPatchOperation): return ApplyPatchResult(status="completed")


async def run_shell(request):
    return "shell output"


agent = Agent(
    name="Local tools agent",
    tools=[
        ShellTool(executor=run_shell),
        ApplyPatchTool(editor=NoopEditor()),
        # ComputerTool expects a Computer/AsyncComputer implementation; omitted here for brevity.
    ],
)
```

## Function tools

You can use any Python function as a tool. The Agents SDK will setup the tool automatically:

-   The name of the tool will be the name of the Python function (or you can provide a name)
-   Tool description will be taken from the docstring of the function (or you can provide a description)
-   The schema for the function inputs is automatically created from the function's arguments
-   Descriptions for each input are taken from the docstring of the function, unless disabled

We use Python's `inspect` module to extract the function signature, along with [`griffe`](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/griffe/) to parse docstrings and `pydantic` for schema creation.

```python
import json

from typing_extensions import TypedDict, Any

from agents import Agent, FunctionTool, RunContextWrapper, function_tool


class Location(TypedDict):
    lat: float
    long: float

@function_tool  # (1)!
async def fetch_weather(location: Location) -> str:
    # (2)!
    """Fetch the weather for a given location.

    Args:
        location: The location to fetch the weather for.
    """
    # In real life, we'd fetch the weather from a weather API
    return "sunny"


@function_tool(name_override="fetch_data")  # (3)!
def read_file(ctx: RunContextWrapper[Any], path: str, directory: str | None = None) -> str:
    """Read the contents of a file.

    Args:
        path: The path to the file to read.
        directory: The directory to read the file from.
    """
    # In real life, we'd read the file from the file system
    return "<file contents>"


agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    tools=[fetch_weather, read_file],  # (4)!
)

for tool in agent.tools:
    if isinstance(tool, FunctionTool):
        print(tool.name)
        print(tool.description)
        print(json.dumps(tool.params_json_schema, indent=2))
        print()

```

1.  You can use any Python types as arguments to your functions, and the function can be sync or async.
2.  Docstrings, if present, are used to capture descriptions and argument descriptions
3.  Functions can optionally take the `context` (must be the first argument). You can also set overrides, like the name of the tool, description, which docstring style to use, etc.
4.  You can pass the decorated functions to the list of tools.

    ```
    fetch_weather

    {
    "$defs": {
      "Location": {
        "properties": {
          "lat": {
            "title": "Lat",
            "type": "number"
          },
          "long": {
            "title": "Long",
            "type": "number"
          }
        },

      }
    },

    ],

    }

    fetch_data
    Read the contents of a file.
    {
    "properties": {
      "path": {
        "description": "The path to the file to read.",
        "title": "Path",

      },
      "directory": {
        "anyOf": [
          {
            "type": "string"
          },

          }
        ],

    "required": [
      "path"
    ],
    "title": "fetch_data_args",
    "type": "object"
    }
    ```

### Returning images or files from function tools

In addition to returning text outputs, you can return one or many images or files as the output of a function tool. To do so, you can return any of:

-   Images: [`ToolOutputImage`][agents.tool.ToolOutputImage] (or the TypedDict version, [`ToolOutputImageDict`][agents.tool.ToolOutputImageDict])
-   Files: [`ToolOutputFileContent`][agents.tool.ToolOutputFileContent] (or the TypedDict version, [`ToolOutputFileContentDict`][agents.tool.ToolOutputFileContentDict])
-   Text: either a string or stringable objects, or [`ToolOutputText`][agents.tool.ToolOutputText] (or the TypedDict version, [`ToolOutputTextDict`][agents.tool.ToolOutputTextDict])

### Custom function tools

Sometimes, you don't want to use a Python function as a tool. You can directly create a [`FunctionTool`][agents.tool.FunctionTool] if you prefer. You'll need to provide:

-   `name`
-   `description`
-   `params_json_schema`, which is the JSON schema for the arguments
-   `on_invoke_tool`, which is an async function that receives a [`ToolContext`][agents.tool_context.ToolContext] and the arguments as a JSON string, and must return the tool output as a string.

```python
from typing import Any

from pydantic import BaseModel

from agents import RunContextWrapper, FunctionTool



def do_some_work(data: str) -> str:
    return "done"


class FunctionArgs(BaseModel):
    username: str
    age: int


async def run_function(ctx: RunContextWrapper[Any], args: str) -> str:
    parsed = FunctionArgs.model_validate_json(args)
    return do_some_work(data=f"{parsed.username} is {parsed.age} years old")


tool = FunctionTool(
    name="process_user",
    description="Processes extracted user data",
    params_json_schema=FunctionArgs.model_json_schema(),
    on_invoke_tool=run_function,
)
```

### Automatic argument and docstring parsing

As mentioned before, we automatically parse the function signature to extract the schema for the tool, and we parse the docstring to extract descriptions for the tool and for individual arguments. Some notes on that:

1. The signature parsing is done via the `inspect` module. We use type annotations to understand the types for the arguments, and dynamically build a Pydantic model to represent the overall schema. It supports most types, including Python primitives, Pydantic models, TypedDicts, and more.
2. We use `griffe` to parse docstrings. Supported docstring formats are `google`, `sphinx` and `numpy`. We attempt to automatically detect the docstring format, but this is best-effort and you can explicitly set it when calling `function_tool`. You can also disable docstring parsing by setting `use_docstring_info` to `False`.

The code for the schema extraction lives in [`agents.function_schema`][].

## Agents as tools

In some workflows, you may want a central agent to orchestrate a network of specialized agents, instead of handing off control. You can do this by modeling agents as tools.

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
import asyncio

spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="Spanish agent",
    instructions="You translate the user's message to Spanish",
)

french_agent = Agent(
    name="French agent",
    instructions="You translate the user's message to French",
)

orchestrator_agent = Agent(
    name="orchestrator_agent",
    instructions=(
        "You are a translation agent. You use the tools given to you to translate."
        "If asked for multiple translations, you call the relevant tools."
    ),
    tools=[
        spanish_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="translate_to_spanish",
            tool_description="Translate the user's message to Spanish",
        ),
        french_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="translate_to_french",
            tool_description="Translate the user's message to French",
        ),
    ],
)

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(orchestrator_agent, input="Say 'Hello, how are you?' in Spanish.")
    print(result.final_output)
```

### Customizing tool-agents

The `agent.as_tool` function is a convenience method to make it easy to turn an agent into a tool. It doesn't support all configuration though; for example, you can't set `max_turns`. For advanced use cases, use `Runner.run` directly in your tool implementation:

```python
@function_tool
async def run_my_agent() -> str:
    """A tool that runs the agent with custom configs"""

    agent = Agent(name="My agent", instructions="...")

    result = await Runner.run(
        agent,
        input="...",
        max_turns=5,
        run_config=...
    )

    return str(result.final_output)
```

### Custom output extraction

In certain cases, you might want to modify the output of the tool-agents before returning it to the central agent. This may be useful if you want to:

-   Extract a specific piece of information (e.g., a JSON payload) from the sub-agent's chat history.
-   Convert or reformat the agent’s final answer (e.g., transform Markdown into plain text or CSV).
-   Validate the output or provide a fallback value when the agent’s response is missing or malformed.

You can do this by supplying the `custom_output_extractor` argument to the `as_tool` method:

```python
async def extract_json_payload(run_result: RunResult) -> str:
    # Scan the agent’s outputs in reverse order until we find a JSON-like message from a tool call.
    for item in reversed(run_result.new_items):
        if isinstance(item, ToolCallOutputItem) and item.output.strip().startswith("{"):
            return item.output.strip()
    # Fallback to an empty JSON object if nothing was found
    return "{}"


json_tool = data_agent.as_tool(
    tool_name="get_data_json",
    tool_description="Run the data agent and return only its JSON payload",
    custom_output_extractor=extract_json_payload,
)
```

### Streaming nested agent runs

Pass an `on_stream` callback to `as_tool` to listen to streaming events emitted by the nested agent while still returning its final output once the stream completes.

```python
from agents import AgentToolStreamEvent


async def handle_stream(event: AgentToolStreamEvent) -> None:
    # Inspect the underlying StreamEvent along with agent metadata.
    print(f"[stream] {event['agent']['name']} :: {event['event'].type}")


billing_agent_tool = billing_agent.as_tool(
    tool_name="billing_helper",
    tool_description="Answer billing questions.",
    on_stream=handle_stream,  # Can be sync or async.
)
```

What to expect:

- Event types mirror `StreamEvent["type"]`: `raw_response_event`, `run_item_stream_event`, `agent_updated_stream_event`.
- Providing `on_stream` automatically runs the nested agent in streaming mode and drains the stream before returning the final output.
- The handler may be synchronous or asynchronous; each event is delivered in order as it arrives.
- `tool_call_id` is present when the tool is invoked via a model tool call; direct calls may leave it `None`.
- See `examples/agent_patterns/agents_as_tools_streaming.py` for a complete runnable sample.

### Conditional tool enabling

You can conditionally enable or disable agent tools at runtime using the `is_enabled` parameter. This allows you to dynamically filter which tools are available to the LLM based on context, user preferences, or runtime conditions.

```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, AgentBase, Runner, RunContextWrapper
from pydantic import BaseModel

class LanguageContext(BaseModel):
    language_preference: str = "french_spanish"

def french_enabled(ctx: RunContextWrapper[LanguageContext], agent: AgentBase) -> bool:
    """Enable French for French+Spanish preference."""
    return ctx.context.language_preference == "french_spanish"

# Create specialized agents
spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="spanish_agent",
    instructions="You respond in Spanish. Always reply to the user's question in Spanish.",
)

french_agent = Agent(
    name="french_agent",
    instructions="You respond in French. Always reply to the user's question in French.",
)

# Create orchestrator with conditional tools
orchestrator = Agent(
    name="orchestrator",
    instructions=(
        "You are a multilingual assistant. You use the tools given to you to respond to users. "
        "You must call ALL available tools to provide responses in different languages. "
        "You never respond in languages yourself, you always use the provided tools."
    ),
    tools=[
        spanish_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="respond_spanish",
            tool_description="Respond to the user's question in Spanish",
            is_enabled=True,  # Always enabled
        ),
        french_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="respond_french",
            tool_description="Respond to the user's question in French",
            is_enabled=french_enabled,
        ),
    ],
)

async def main():
    context = RunContextWrapper(LanguageContext(language_preference="french_spanish"))
    result = await Runner.run(orchestrator, "How are you?", context=context.context)
    print(result.final_output)

asyncio.run(main())
```

The `is_enabled` parameter accepts:

-   **Boolean values**: `True` (always enabled) or `False` (always disabled)
-   **Callable functions**: Functions that take `(context, agent)` and return a boolean
-   **Async functions**: Async functions for complex conditional logic

Disabled tools are completely hidden from the LLM at runtime, making this useful for:

-   Feature gating based on user permissions
-   Environment-specific tool availability (dev vs prod)
-   A/B testing different tool configurations
-   Dynamic tool filtering based on runtime state

## Experimental: Codex tool

The `codex_tool` wraps the Codex CLI so an agent can run workspace-scoped tasks (shell, file edits, MCP tools)
during a tool call. This surface is experimental and may change.

```python
from agents import Agent
from agents.extensions.experimental.codex import ThreadOptions, codex_tool

agent = Agent(
    name="Codex Agent",
    instructions="Use the codex tool to inspect the workspace and answer the question.",
    tools=[
        codex_tool(
            sandbox_mode="workspace-write",
            working_directory="/path/to/repo",
            default_thread_options=ThreadOptions(
                model="gpt-5.2-codex",
                network_access_enabled=True,
                web_search_enabled=False,
            ),
            persist_session=True,
        )
    ],
)
```

What to know:

-   Auth: set `CODEX_API_KEY` (preferred) or `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or pass `codex_options={"api_key": "..."}`.
-   Inputs: tool calls must include at least one item in `inputs` with `{ "type": "text", "text": ... }` or `{ "type": "local_image", "path": ... }`.
-   Safety: pair `sandbox_mode` with `working_directory`; set `skip_git_repo_check=True` outside Git repos.
-   Behavior: `persist_session=True` reuses a single Codex thread and returns its `thread_id`.
-   Streaming: `on_stream` receives Codex events (reasoning, command execution, MCP tool calls, file changes, web search).
-   Outputs: results include `response`, `usage`, and `thread_id`; usage is added to `RunContextWrapper.usage`.
-   Structure: `output_schema` enforces structured Codex responses when you need typed outputs.
-   See `examples/tools/codex.py` for a complete runnable sample.

## Handling errors in function tools

When you create a function tool via `@function_tool`, you can pass a `failure_error_function`. This is a function that provides an error response to the LLM in case the tool call crashes.

-   By default (i.e. if you don't pass anything), it runs a `default_tool_error_function` which tells the LLM an error occurred.
-   If you pass your own error function, it runs that instead, and sends the response to the LLM.
-   If you explicitly pass `None`, then any tool call errors will be re-raised for you to handle. This could be a `ModelBehaviorError` if the model produced invalid JSON, or a `UserError` if your code crashed, etc.

```python
from agents import function_tool, RunContextWrapper
from typing import Any

def my_custom_error_function(context: RunContextWrapper[Any], error: Exception) -> str:
    """A custom function to provide a user-friendly error message."""
    print(f"A tool call failed with the following error: {error}")
    return "An internal server error occurred. Please try again later."

@function_tool(failure_error_function=my_custom_error_function)
def get_user_profile(user_id: str) -> str:
    """Fetches a user profile from a mock API.
     This function demonstrates a 'flaky' or failing API call.
    """
    if user_id == "user_123":
        return "User profile for user_123 successfully retrieved."
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Could not retrieve profile for user_id: {user_id}. API returned an error.")

```

If you are manually creating a `FunctionTool` object, then you must handle errors inside the `on_invoke_tool` function.
